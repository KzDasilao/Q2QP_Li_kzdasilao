    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>Back in 1984, a scrappy group of friends from far corners of the globe settled in a remote area of Utah’s
            high desert … and took the first steps to forever changing the future for pets in shelters.</p><br>
        <p>It’s the story of Best Friends, but it’s much more than the history of a spot on the map. This group of
            ordinary but passionate people believed that every pet has a story, too, each one worth saving, each
            life individual and important. Today, nearly four decades after they broke ground for a sanctuary in a
            remote region of the Southwest, achieving no-kill across the entire country is within reach.</p>
