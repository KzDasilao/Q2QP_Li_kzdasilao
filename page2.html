            <h2>INITIATIVES</h2>
            <p>We are determined to take the
                entire country to no-kill by 2025.
                We've got the expertise and we've got the
                passion. And we've got the road map. So together,
                we are creating progressive new initiatives while
                growing the programs - trap-neuter-vaccinate-return for community cats, shelter foster
                networking, online resource centers to provide
                neighborhood support, and more - that have
                already brought us close to our goal</p>
                <h3>We’ve collected data for 95% of
                    pets in America’s shelters, which
                    tells us where help is needed most
                    and which animals are most at risk.<br>Best Friends works with more than
                    4,200 shelter and rescue partners
                    across all 50 states. More than 550
                    new partners joined the Best Friends
                    Network in 2022.<br>Best Friends is investing in
                    proven programs that help
                    shelters save more lives and
                    inspire action.</h3>

            <h2>INVOLVEMENTS</h2>
            <p>1. 4.4 million
                pets entered
                America’s
                shelters in
                2022, an
                increase of
                nearly 2%
                since 2021.<br>
                2. 378,000 dogs
                and cats were
                killed in
                America’s
                shelters. That’s
                roughly 1,000
                per day.<br>
                3. Dog adoptions lost
                ground to breeder
                purchases. In
                2022, dogs made
                up 45% of the
                animals killed in
                America’s
                shelters, a steep
                increase from 30%
                in 2021.<br>
                4. Overall,
                shelters
                experienced a
                higher volume
                of intakes, while
                adoptions and
                fostering did
                not keep pace.</p>
                <h3>Just 1% of shelters
                    make up nearly 60%
                    of the increase in
                    dogs and cats killed.<br>
                    No-kill isn’t just
                    possible, it’s
                    sustainable.
                    Nationwide, 93% of
                    shelters that were no-kill in 2021 remained
                    no-kill in 2022.<br>
                    Of the 3,943 shelters
                    in the United States,
                    57% of them are now
                    no-kill. This is an
                    increase from 52% in
                    2021.</h3>
