                <p> Best Friends Animal Society is a leading animal welfare organization working to end
                    the killing of dogs and cats in America’s shelters by 2025. Founded in 1984, Best
                    Friends is a pioneer in the no-kill movement and has helped reduce the number of

                    largest no-kill animal sanctuary.</p>
